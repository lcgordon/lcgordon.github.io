								<h1>Creon</h1>
								<p id='art'>You are the current king of Thebes. Your brother Laius used to be king, before he was killed by a stranger while traveling. A man named Oedipus came
								to Thebes and solved the Sphinx's riddle and became the new king in his stead and married your sister-in-law Jocasta. <br></br> They ruled for many years
							until a plague struck the city and the truth came out: Oedipus was Laius and Jocasta's long-presumed-dead son and his own father's killer. Leadership of
						Thebes passed to his sons Polynices and Eteoles, who were unable to co-rule Thebes peacefully and launched a civil war. They destroyed each other, and you
					were left to pick up the pieces.</p>
